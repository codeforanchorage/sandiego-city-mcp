    A marker, not a behaviour change: it exists so the outer handler can

    broke", and log the first at WARNING with no traceback. A traceback
    is a claim that the server failed; spending one on "you forgot
    item_id" is what makes real faults hard to find.

    Deliberately NOT inferred from ValueError alone. That heuristic is
    wrong in two ways here:
      * json.JSONDecodeError subclasses ValueError, so a malformed
        upstream payload would be misfiled as a caller mistake and lose
        its stack trace.
      * The ArcGIS wrapper raises plain ValueError for "Feature Service
        returned non-JSON" -- a genuine upstream fault whose traceback
        we want.
    Both stay plain ValueError and keep their tracebacks.

    Subclasses ValueError so every existing `except ValueError` keeps
    working, which makes converting a raise site mechanical and safe.
